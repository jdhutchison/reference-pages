The eggplant takes the place of pasta sheets. As this is such a simple dish, it is crucial to use plenty of fresh herbs. Fresh goat's curd is an excellent substitute for the sour cream.

**Cooking time:** 30 minutes
**Pre-heat oven to:** 180 C
**Serves:** 4-6

Ingredients
-----------
- 100ml olive oil
- 1 medium brown onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- Salt
- Pepper
- 810g tin whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup fresh oregano leaves
- 2 medium eggplants, thinly sliced
- 300g sour cream
- 150g parmesan, grated

Method
------
1. Pre-heat oven to 180C. Pre-heat a grill or barbecue to hot.

2. Place olive oil, onion and garlic in a saucepan. Season and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and simmer, stir to prevent catching until sauce is thick. Stir in herbs and take off the heat.

3. While sauce is reducing, grill eggplants on both sides until cooked through.

4. Take a 25cm x 20cm baking dish and layer with tomato, eggplant, spoonfuls of sour cream and cheese. Repeat. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden and bubbling. Serve with a green salad.
