The Reference Pages project
===========================

Static generation from markdown for reference pages for my personal site. There's some Python processing scripts for converting markdown exported from Joplin into somethig more useful for Hugo. And then theres the hugo configuration, including the most recent converted markdown.

Structure
---------

The project has two folders:

**processors**: Python scripts to convert exported markdown. 

**hugo**: Configuration and content for Hugo to run with. 
.
